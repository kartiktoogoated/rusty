/**
 * Macros in rust
 * a macro is like a shortcut that writes code for you so you dont have to repeat 
 * yourself again and again
 * like if you need one thing in your code that are getting used oftenly you just create a macro of it and call it again somewhere as a function.
 * Without a macro:
println!("Hello, Kartik!");
println!("Hello, Kartik!");
println!("Hello, Kartik!");
With a macro:
greet!();
greet!();
greet!();

ðŸ¤¯ Why not just use functions?

Because macros can do crazy powerful things that functions canâ€™t â€” like:
Take any kind of input (not just fixed types).
Generate new variables or code at compile time.
Work with Rust syntax itself.
